# Project Proposal: Conway's Game of Life in ARM Assembly

## (1) Title and Project Track
**Title:** Conway's Game of Life in ARM Assembly
**Track:** Self-Proposed Project

## (2) Project Description
This will be an ARM assembly implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The project will involve creating a simulation of the game, where cells on a grid can be either alive or dead, and their states change based on a set of rules. The project will focus on optimizing the performance of the simulation, as well as implementing the game logic in ARM-64 assembly language.
I always have been fascinated by the Game of Life and I think it will be a great project to work on. I will be using the ARM assembly language to implement the game logic and optimize the performance of the simulation. Cellular automata are fascinating to me and i think this will be a really good fundamental project to work on and learn from.

## (3) Tools and Platforms
For this project we will be using Raspberry Pi's running ARM-64 to compile and run the code.
- **Programming Language:** ARM Assembly, C libraries for printing to the console and other high level functions that are not in the scope of what we are trying to demonstrate and learn from this project.
- **Development Environment:** Raspberry Pi with ARM-64 architecture
- **Tools:** ARM assembler, text editor, and terminal for compilation and execution
- **Version Control:** Git for version control and collaboration
- **Documentation:** Markdown for documentation and README files


## (4) Project Timeline and Milestones
#### **Week 1 April 1st - April 7th:**
- build the basic structure of the project
- implement the basic game logic in ARM assembly

#### **Week 2 April 8th - April 14th:**
- get the game to display the grid and the cells on the console 
- build several template patterns to test the game logic and be able to swap between them on the fly

#### **Week 3 April 15th - April 21st:**
- debug and verify the game logic and optimization is working as expected

#### **Project Due Date:** April 22nd, at 11:59 PM
- Submit the final project and documentation


## (5) Course Concepts Applied
- Memory Allocation and Management: Understanding how to manage memory in ARM assembly, including stack and heap allocation.
- Control Flow: Implementing loops and conditionals in assembly language to control the game logic.
